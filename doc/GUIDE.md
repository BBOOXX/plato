## Configure

The settings are saved in and read from `Settings.toml`. You can edit this file when *Plato* isn't running or is in shared mode. You can enter the shared mode by connecting your device to a computer.

The default ePUB stylesheet, `css/epub.css`, can be overriden via `css/epub-user.css`.
